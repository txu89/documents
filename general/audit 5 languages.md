### Python  
**Pros**  
1.	Easy to read code – due to less syntax and strict use of whitespace (indentation), it helps keep the code clean and easier to read.  
2.	A lot of good tutorials and documentation to make it easier to learn. Python also comes with a large standard library, which makes it easier to get started coding immediately.  
**Cons**  
1.	Dynamically typed variables – the variable type is not declared until a value is assigned. While this gives you freedom using the variable it can cause some issues down the line since they are not type checked at compile-time.  
2. Slow – due to being an interpreted language, it can run much slower than a compiled language.  
### Javascript  
**Pros**  
1.	Works directly from browser - Easy to get started to test and run code.  
2.	Loosely typed – variable can be any type which gives more freedom. Functions can take in any type argument and return a value of any type.  
**Cons**  
1.	Runs client side – since there is no standard support across browsers, it may run differently.  
2.	Loosely typed – can be confusing and unintuitive working with variables that are different types.  
### Scala  
**Pros**  
1.	Builds on top of Java ecosystem – it can use existing tools and libraries that are built on JVM. Also means that it is simple to run and deploy as only JVM is needed to be installed.  
2.	Syntax is simple and straightforward – can reduce code by 50% or more when compared to Java. This means more efficiency and productivity.  
**Cons**  
1.	Inferior IDE – Lacking many features especially compared to more mature languages. Some existing features are buggy.
2.	Smaller community – Not many developers existing that already know Scala and there are less resources to learn from.
### Java  
**Pros**  
1.	Garbage collection – Automatically reclaims unused memory by removing unreferenced objects from memory.  
2.	Cross-Platform – designed so that it will work on basically any system, just need JVM installed.  
**Cons**  
1.	Highly verbose – generally requires much more lines of code compared to other languages to do the same thing.  
2.	Slow – slower and more memory consuming then languages like C or C++.  
### PHP  
**Pros**  
1.	Popular and easy to learn – Due to the widespread popularity and ease of deployment, it is found on most servers. There are a lot of resource and large community to assist in learning and many solutions using PHP can already be found online.  
2.	“Just works” – It’s very easy to get something working as PHP does not care how you go about it. There are many ways to accomplish the same task.  
**Cons**  
1.	A lot of bad code written in PHP – because it is so easy to use and highly flexible, a lot of existing code in PHP is poorly written and best practice not followed.  
2.	Bad perception – Because of its open source nature and low barrier to entry, there is often a negative perception regarding PHP.
